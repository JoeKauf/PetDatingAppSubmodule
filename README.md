## I. Statement of Purpose
In the ideal world, potential adopters could adopt a cat or a dog without the concept 
of an animal they donâ€™t choose being euthanized. However, this is not the case. Around 
1.5 million animals are put down in shelters each year. Many of these animals are 
capable of being a fantastic pet, but shelters are full and need to make room for 
incoming animals. In order to combat this, I propose that a pet adoption app is 
created that is catered towards younger generations. With an ever increasing size 
of the internet and the popularity of apps like Tik Tok, this generation is not 
being accounted for as much on the adoption scene. Tik Tok has approximately 
[100 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiktok-now-150-million-active-users-us-ceo-tell-congress-rcna75607) 
regular American users. The pet adoption app will help drive demand by 
showing animals in ways that are addicting and easy to learn. Even though animal 
euthenasia is high, fighting it by using apps could decrease that number to more 
modest numbers.
