## I. Statement of Purpose
In the ideal world, potential adopters could adopt a cat or a dog without the concept 
of an animal they donâ€™t choose being euthanized. However, this is not the case. Around 
1.5 million animals are put down in shelters each year. Many of these animals are 
capable of being a fantastic pet, but shelters are full and need to make room for 
incoming animals. In order to combat this, I propose that a pet adoption app is 
created that is catered towards younger generations. With an ever increasing size 
of the internet and the popularity of apps like Tik Tok, this generation is not 
being accounted for as much on the adoption scene. Tik Tok has approximately 
[100 million](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiktok-now-150-million-active-users-us-ceo-tell-congress-rcna75607) 
regular American users. The pet adoption app will help drive demand by 
showing animals in ways that are addicting and easy to learn. Even though animal 
euthenasia is high, fighting it by using apps could decrease that number to more 
modest numbers.

## II. Research & Background
### **UX Design**
#### Figma
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is powerful software used to create elegant user interfaces. It is used by Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, and many more 
[companies](https://8designers.com/blog/what-big-companies-use-figma#:~:text=It's%20no%20wonder%20companies%20like,for%20businesses%20of%20all%20sizes.).
Figma is used by dragging and dropping layers onto a screen. This
simplicity of use enabled me to develop a user interface very rapidly.
#### Principles
UX design follows a few [key principles](https://uxplanet.org/mobile-ux-design-key-principles-dee1a632f9e6):
1. Simplicity
2. Make Buttons [42-72 pixels](https://uxmovement.com/mobile/optimal-size-and-spacing-for-mobile-buttons/#:~:text=The%20highest%20accuracy%20was%20found,the%20middle%20of%20the%20range.)
3. Place Buttons [Near Thumb](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php)
4. Use Buttons for Data Validation
5. Simple Onboarding

### **Dating App Key Features**
#### Filtering
Although filters can vary from app to app, [Bumble](https://bumble.com/), [Tinder](https://tinder.com/), and [Hinge](https://hinge.co/) allow users to filter by 
age, sexual orientation, and distance. This helps users eliminate those they are not likely to 
match with and only shows profiles within their preferences. Bumble and Hinge have many more filters
which can range from fun questions to lifestyle questions.
#### Swiping
Swiping is a staple of dating apps popularized by Tinder.
A user is shown another user's profile. Here they have the choose to either swipe left or swipe 
right. Swiping left hides the profile. Swiping right likes the profile.
#### Matching
If two users swipe right on each other's profile, they match. The app will notify users and 
now...
#### Chatting
They can start messaging one another. Bumble adds a little twist to this common feature.
On the app, [only women are allowed to start chats](https://bumble.com/en/help/how-does-messaging-work-on-bumble#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20on,to%20lock%20in%20your%20connection.). This helps to seperate it from most other dating apps.

### **Dating App Algorithms**
#### Elo Rating
The first algorithm that dating apps employ is called the Elo Rating.
Elo Ratings were originally created to show the rankings of chess players.
The higher the elo rating the higher the chance of them beating their opponent.
On dating apps, these scores are used to determine the chances of being swiped right on.
In other terms, it is an attractiveness rating. The goal of the app is to get the user
hooked as soon as possible. They show the user the most attractive users on the platform
and inflate the number of attractive users by showing them as frequently as possible.
Attractiveness ratings have received a lot of questions regarding ethicality lately.

#### Similarity Algorithm 
Once the app has a little more data on a particular user, the app is able to implement a 
Similarity Algorithm. These algorithms tailor better to the individual preferences of users.
They serve as predictive algorithms that look at your swipe history and who similar users have
liked in the past. Analyze the following situation:
* John likes Sarah, Jane, and Leah.
* Greg likes Sarah and Jane. 
Who is should Greg be shown next? Greg should be shown Leah. Similarity algorithms are more complex than this and integrate a lot more data.
